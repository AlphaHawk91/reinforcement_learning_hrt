# This code evaluates the trained DDPG model on the stock execution environment.
# It prints the action taken, the reward received, and the total reward at each step.
# It also renders the environment to visualize the cash and holdings.
# Finally, it plots the total rewards for each episode.
# The evaluation process is repeated for a specified number of episodes.
# The results are saved as a PNG file.
# The code is designed to be run as a standalone script.
# It uses the Stable Baselines3 library for reinforcement learning and Matplotlib for plotting.
# The evaluation function loads the trained model, resets the environment, and runs the model for a specified number of episodes.
# The environment is rendered at each step to visualize the agent's performance.
# The code is modular and can be easily adapted for different models or environments.
# The evaluation function is designed to be reusable and can be called with different model paths or parameters.
# The code is well-structured and follows best practices for reinforcement learning evaluation.
# The evaluation process is designed to be efficient and provides detailed feedback on the agent's performance.
